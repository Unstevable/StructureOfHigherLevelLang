# StructureOfHigherLevelLang
A simple GitHub repo to store old Racket files for my Structure of Higher Level Languages course.

A series of small-scale Racket programs to supplement the course topic, including: implementing infinite and finite stream sets, the substitution operation, the evaluation of expressions and terms using a mutable environment, memory management, effectful operations and translation of a SimpleJS function into LambdaJS.
